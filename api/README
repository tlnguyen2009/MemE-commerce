The flow for designing Stripe by PaymentIntent and Elements:

        User fills out card info in your custom form
                |
                ▼
        Frontend sends form data to Stripe Elements
                |
                ▼
        Frontend calls your backend to create a PaymentIntent
                |
                ▼
        Stripe returns client_secret → sent back to frontend
                |
                ▼
        Frontend calls stripe.confirmCardPayment(client_secret)
                |
                ▼
        Stripe processes payment + authentication (e.g., 3D Secure)
                |
                ▼
        PaymentIntent status updates: succeeded / failed
                |
                ▼
        You handle UI result (success screen, error, etc.)
